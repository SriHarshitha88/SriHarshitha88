I'm a pre-final year Computer Science student with a passion for web development,dedicated to bringing ideas to life in the browser.Growing up in the '90s and early 2000s, my fascination with the internet led me to design and develop fast, responsive, and accessible websites and web applications.

Currently, I'm expanding my expertise into DevOps to streamline development processes and improve deployment efficiency. I'm also exploring Web3, focusing on Solidity, Rust, and building decentralized apps on Ethereum and Solana.

## üåü Featured Projects

- I'm currently working on a project that allows users to track, review, and share books they've read. It features user profiles, book reviews, ratings, customizable reading lists, and personal shelves. The platform also offers reading statistics, a recommendation system based on preferences, social interaction through comments and likes, and community challenges to engage users in shared reading goals. It's a space for book lovers to explore, discuss, and document their reading experiences.

## üìÉ I love documentation

Not many developers like to write documentation, but I do. I believe that a well-documented codebase is as important as the code itself. It‚Äôs like a story, telling what the code can do and how it works. I always try to write clear, concise, and useful documentation.

Whenever I write documentation, I try to keep the following steps in mind to ensure the reader gets the most out of it:

1. **What** is this documentation about?
2. **Why** is this documentation important?
3. **How** can the reader use this documentation?
4. **When** should the reader use this documentation?
5. **Who** is this documentation for?


### <p align="center">‚öôÔ∏è My development environment </p>

> I grew up with Windows and it holds a special place in my heart. It‚Äôs my go-to operating system for development, where I make extensive use of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and the Windows Terminal. I also use PowerShell, which I‚Äôve customized with my own configurations built from and modules scratch, to create a highly efficient and personalized terminal environment.
